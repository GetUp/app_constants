AppConstants is now installed! A couple of things you should know:

  1. You now have a file under Rails.root/config called constants.yml

     Use this file to add you environment specific constants

  2. The initializer lives under Rails.root/config/initializers and is called load_app_constants.rb

     This is where the gem gets set up and where you can customize the location of the constants.yml file

  3. Enjoy!
